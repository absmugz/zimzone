    <h3>When should I expect an answer?</h3>

    <div>
        <p>Once you've sent a message to our support system you should immediately receive a confirmation in your inbox. If not, <strong>check your spam folder</strong> and make sure you've entered your email correctly.</p>
        <p>If you got the confirmation email, hang tight. We try to answer all requests <strong>within 24 hours</strong> and usually faster than that.</p>
        <p>Note: Support is handled from Belgium, so there might be some delay due to different timezones.</p>
